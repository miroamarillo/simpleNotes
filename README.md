#SimpleNotes

Simple note taker or sticky notes with the ability to update and delete.

##Set up MongoDB

Initially this was just a test on how to create and delete notes.  I decided to use **mongo** to store the notes when new are added and update the database when they are deleted.

1. Start Mongo Daemon in the terminal

	````
	mongod
	````
2. Run mongo in another terminal window

	````
	mongo
	````
